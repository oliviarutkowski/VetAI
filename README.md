# VetAI

VetAI is a simple demonstration app showcasing AI-assisted veterinary diagnostics.

## Navigation

The app now features three main tabs:

1. **Home** – View recent diagnoses and start a new case.
2. **AI Diagnosis** – Enter lab values and use the embedded triage section to submit symptoms and receive guidance.
3. **Profile** – Manage owner and pet information.

The previous standalone triage screen has been removed. Symptom entry and triage results are now part of the AI Diagnosis screen.
